This theme has two objectives:

- Backend Content Restriction: Prevents content from being displayed in the WordPress admin backend, ensuring the focus is on external rendering.
- CRUD Notification: Sends a ping to the external App whenever posts or pages are created, updated, or deleted, facilitating cache invalidation or synchronisation.
